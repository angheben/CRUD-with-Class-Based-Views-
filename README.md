The idea of this project was to apply some conepts of the Class Based Views

I took a ready bootstrap template with some commun concepts of HTML such as NavBar, Header, Employees etc, that you see in a lot of company templates 
and bring to my models.py to register in my database

The HTML template looks like that

The first thing I've made was extrude my HTML templates in separeted files to facilitate the edition as this picture bellow:

After that I've performed the registration of 5 people friends of mine in to my database and made the register by the django admin page

Not just the people but I've made the registration of some services objects to

This was a very hard project that teach me a lot of diferent concepts mainly in the HTML templates

Enjoy!
